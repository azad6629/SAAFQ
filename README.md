## ðŸ§© Overview
SAAFQ introduces **scale-aware adaptive feature quantization** to improve robustness of medical image representations under domain shift and perturbations.  
Core ideas:
- Adaptive quantization driven by multi-scale statistics
- Robust SSL pretraining compatible with standard backbones
- Strong downstream performance on classification/segmentation
